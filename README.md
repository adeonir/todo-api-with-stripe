## Technologies

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): Next-generation Node.js and TypeScript ORM.
- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod): TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/): Online payment processing for internet businesses.
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/): API design, building, and documentation tool.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available at `/api-docs` endpoint. It is generated using Swagger UI.

You can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` in your browser when the server is running.

## Installation

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun dev
```

## Local Development

This project uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) for local development. SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.

To set up the SQLite database for local development:

```bash
bun prisma migrate dev
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun 'v1.0.33'. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
